# The TWHL GoldSource FGD Collection Project

The goal of this project is to have a centralized collection of GoldSource FGD files that can be maintained, kept up-to-date, and improved.

## What should be part of the collection

All FGDs from official Valve/Gearbox GoldSource games, as well as major games, mods, and SDKs that are considered finalized (i.e. not receiving updates).

## What should ***not*** be part of the collection

Minor FGDs, such as those created for mini-mods or mapping utilities, or in general offers very little of usefulness to a mapper, should not be a part of this project.

### Living FGDs

Official FGDs from games and mods that are still being updated (i.e. still "alive", for example Sven Co-op) should not be a part of this project, as these FGDs should be retrieved from the respective game/mod instead.

These games/mods should be added to the table below with instructions how to retrieve their official FGD:

| Game/mod     | How to get FGD |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Sven Co-op   | Download the game from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/225840/Sven_Coop/).<br>The path to the FGD will be `../Steam/steamapps/common/Sven Co-op/svencoop/sven-coop.fgd` |

Historical versions or alternative versions of these FGDs are welcome.<br>
The file name should use a suffix to signify this:

* Historical versions should use the version number or edition name of the game/mod the FGD was taken from, e.g. `somegame3.2.fgd`.
* Alternative versions should ideally be prefixed with an underscore followed by the author/project name of that alternate version, e.g. `mymod_alternate-author.fgd`.
